# Custom ViewModel Library (Android)

This project demonstrates how Androidâ€™s `ViewModel` architecture component works under the hood. It includes a custom implementation of:

- `ViewModel`
- `ViewModelStore`
- `ViewModelOwner`
- `ViewModelProvider`

The purpose is to help developers understand the internal behavior of `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel` â€” especially how it survives configuration changes and manages the lifecycle of UI-related data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Learn

- How `ViewModel` retains data across configuration changes (like screen rotation).
- How `ViewModelStore` holds ViewModel instances.
- How `ViewModelProvider` retrieves or creates ViewModels using keys.
- How the Activity manages the ViewModel lifecycle using `onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance()` and `onDestroy()`.
